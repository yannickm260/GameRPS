# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project is a simple web-based implementation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. The user can play against the computer by selecting Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the result is displayed on the screen.

## Features

- User can choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The computer randomly selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The result of the game (Win, Lose, or Draw) is displayed based on the user's and the computer's choices.
- Images corresponding to the choices are shown for both the user and the computer.

## Project Structure

### Front-End

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the web page.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Handles styling with utility classes for a responsive and clean UI.
- The interface includes buttons for user input and displays the choices made by the user and the computer.

### Back-End

- **JavaScript**: Handles game logic, including capturing user input, generating random computer choices, and determining the result of the game.
- The game logic also handles displaying images based on the user's and computer's choices.

## How to Play

1. **Choose an Option**: Click on one of the buttons (`Rock`, `Paper`, or `Scissors`).
2. **View the Result**: The computer's choice will be randomly generated, and the result will be displayed on the screen (Win, Lose, or Draw).
3. **Play Again**: You can continue playing by making another selection.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and Tailwind CSS integration for the UI.
